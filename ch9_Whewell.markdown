Whewell's Critique of Newton's Methodology
==========================================

Q's:
    * Can a successful procedure be founded on these rules?
    * What does Whewell think is missing from a 'purely inductive' account
         of the formulation of scientific laws?
    
## Rule 1:
We Are not to admit other causes of natural things than such as both are true, 
and suffice for explaining their phenomena.

Whewell: What if we have no known causes for a phenomena, are we not to explore
it? True cause is vera causa. Must all causes used be as simple as gravity, so
that everyone could understand them. That would not work well for everything.
