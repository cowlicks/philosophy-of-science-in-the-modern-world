Whewell's Critique of Newton's Methodology
==========================================

Q's:
    * Can a successful procedure be founded on these rules?
    * What does Whewell think is missing from a 'purely inductive' account
         of the formulation of scientific laws?
    
## Rule 1:
We Are not to admit other causes of natural things than such as both are true, 
and suffice for explaining their phenomena.

Whewell: What if we have no known causes for a phenomena, are we not to explore
it? True cause is vera causa. Must all causes used be as simple as gravity, so
that everyone could understand them. That would not work well for everything.

Whewell thinks that rule 1 is to strict of a requirement to do induction.

## Rule 2:
Natural effects of the same kind are to be referred to the same causes, as far
as can be done.

Whewell calls this rule unhelpful, other than it implicitly insists that facts be
correct, the chain of reasoning well thought out. Which is always neccessary for
induction. He insists it is unhelpful because it does not give a quanitative way
to assign things to the same causes.

## Rule 3:
The qualities of bodies which cannot be increased or diminished in intensity, and
which belong to all bodies in which we can institute experiments, are to be held
for qualities of all bodies whatever.

To W this rule is used to justify Newton's assertion that gravity is universal.

## Rule 4:
Propositions collected from observation of phenomena by induction should be 
viewed as accurate or very nearly true until contradicted by other phenomena.

Basically use induction.
