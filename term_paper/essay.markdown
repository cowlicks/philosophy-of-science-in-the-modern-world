# Prompt: Can there be an empirical *test* of realisim or antirealism?

Yes, given certain definitions of realisim and antirealisim. An experiment
could be constructed analyzing the history of all scientific theories which
were 'generally accepted' at some time. Then taking each theory's 'postulated
entities' and seeing if they were later proven or disproven to exist. If
proved, realisim receives a 'point', if disproved antirealisim receives a
'point'. Totalling up all these points throughout history would show whether,
in general realist outlook is more 'correct' than an antirealist outlook. 

Of course this is just one metric of comparison, it does not have any
implication as to whether realisim, antirealism, or a debate over the two is
more conducive to the advancement of science. However it would put into
perspective whether strict adherence to either discipline is even worthwhile. 

We need to define a few things to make sense of this.  
What kind of realisim and antirealisim?  
What's a theory?  
What's generally accepted?  
What are 'postulated entities'?  
What does it mean to prove thier existance?   


## Points 

Obviously, awarding a 'point' based on the success of theory,
is not ideal.  Since each theory's postulated entities have a certain
level of plausibility, and it may seem unfair to give a point to
Anti-realisim for [miasma][1], since it now seems so implausible.
However, the realisim antirealism discussion is in general terms, and
whether something exists in 'reality' or is a postulated entity, is
determined by it's observability. Not neccesarily the plausibility of
the postulated entity's existence. Plausibility and observability are
related, but distinct. Observability refers to ability to observe
something using natural senses, plausibility refers to likelyhood of
existence in the context of surrounding scientific theories. So I think
awarding points per theory is acceptable, because the realisim
antirealism debate aknowledges the observability of an object rather
than its plausability.

## Postulated entities

A postulated entity is part of a theory that is not directly verifiable,
but this entity is what causes the phenomena the theory is supposed to
explain. For example the [luminiferous aether][1], [gravitational
field][2], or [caloric][3]. These unobservable by definition, because if
they were observable, then they would be verifiable and not postulated.
A postulated entity can become obsolete if its theory is falsified, or
if another entity is postulated which better explains the phenomena and
the new gains scientific consensus in the community.

## Implications 

If we were to gather a list of past theories our data would probably be
biased toward successful ones. Because when a theory is superseeded it
is more likely to be forgotten, and no longer taught.  With this in
mind, it would seem that almost all postulated entities throughout
history have been modified as experimental techniques improved, or
replaced by a competing theory. It does not seem so suprising to think
that almost all historical theories have had disproven postulated
entities. This would skew our score largely in favor of antirealisim.
But many historical theories are the predecessors to modern ones, and
served as useful stepping stones to a more modern successful theory. It
seems unfair to discredit such a theory which would have been
insturmental in creating a more true theory. However in such a case the
realists insistance on the reality of a postulated entity. Would be
incorrect, strictly speaking. 

Given these considerations it seem that our experiment would be in favor
of the antirealist for decent data set.
