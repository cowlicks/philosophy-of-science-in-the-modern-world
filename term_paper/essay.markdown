4. What is at issue between scientific realism(s) and anti-realism(s)?[1] In
   what sense is Duhem's account anti-realist? How does van Frassen's
antirealism differ from Duhem's?[2] What, very generally is the connection
between anti-realisim and empiricisim?[3] Can there be an empirical defence of
realism, and if so how much can it show?[4] Do Perrin's experiments (and
subsequent developments) really give us grounds for supposing that the
theoretically-introduced terms of theory actually refer to real objects?[5]

[3] Can there be an empirical defence of realism, and if so how much can it
show?

An empirical *test* of realisim.


# Prompt: Can there be an empirical *test* of realisim or antirealism?

Yes, given certain definitions of realisim and antirealisim. An experiment
could be constructed analyzing the history of all scientific theories which
were 'generally accepted' at some time. Then taking each theory's 'postulated
entities' and seeing if they were later proven or disproven to exist. If
proved, realisim receives a 'point', if disproved antirealisim receives a
'point'. Totalling up all these points throughout history would show whether,
in general realist outlook is more 'correct' than an antirealist outlook. 

Of course this is just one metric of comparison, it does not have any
implication as to whether realisim, antirealism, or a debate over the two is
more conducive to the advancement of science. However it would put into
perspective whether strict adherence to either discipline is even worthwhile. 

We need to define a few things to make sense of this.  
What kind of realisim and antirealisim?  
What's a theory?  
What's generally accepted?  
What are 'postulated entities'?  
What does it mean to prove thier existance?   

## Points
Obviously, awarding a 'point' based on the success of theory, is not ideal.
Since each theory's postulated entities have a certain level of plausibility,
and it may seem unfair to give a point to Anti-realisim for [miasma][1], since
it now seems so implausible. However, the realisim antirealism discussion is in
general terms, and whether something exists in 'reality' or is a postulated
entity, is determined by it's observability. Not neccesarily the plausibility
of the postulated entity's existence. Plausibility and observability are
related, but distinct. Observability refers to ability to observe something
using natural senses, plausibility refers to likelyhood of existence in the
context of surrounding scientific theories. So I think awarding points per
theory is acceptable, because the realisim antirealism debate aknowledges the
observability of an object rather than its plausability.

## Implications
What would this experiment actually imply?
