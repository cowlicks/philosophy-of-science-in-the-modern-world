    Descartes' methodology, and therefore his physics, is largely not empirical. He
beleived that one could only arrive at "true knowledge" through deduction, saying
"One ought to seek [...] what we can clearly and evidently intuit or deduce with
certainty." (pg 49). Among the things Descartes considered *certain* was the
existence of God; So it played a sizeable role in deducing his physics.

    Descartes described a conservation law for what he calls "quantity of
motion". Which must be conserved because the initial quantity of motion was
created by God, so it must be perfect, and therefore that quantity must persist
unchanged. This law was clearly not tested empirically tested, because by
Descartes definition of it is not conserved.

    Descartes' gives an emperical example for his second law, namely a stone in
a sling. Despite this he offers a proof based on the immutibility of god.
Showing that he would rather rely on god than an experiment.

It was known to Descartes that his laws
