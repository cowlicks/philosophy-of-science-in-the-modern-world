# Galileo and Copernican ideas

The issue now is whether or not the earth is stationary.

Considering frames of refrence. If someone is writing on a ship
traveling from to greece to athens, how much has the pen moved? How much
has it moved relative to the book? So you need to specify the frame of
refrence in which things are moving. 

## Ideas of natrual motions. 

Fire and air want to go up.

Other thins want to go down. 

Galileo uses these natural motion arguments when he is being tried in
court. Aristotellians vs Galileo.

Hankison is basically reading out of the book to us, the 4 people in
class, and I am working on scipy stuff.

Cue Hankinson's cell phone ringing. He is describing people talking
about balls rolling down hills.

Galileo tricks this dang guy into thinking physics is real with his
dirty tricks.
