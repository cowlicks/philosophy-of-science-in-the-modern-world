# Perrin's realism: Salmon
## pages 312-326

I did the wrong reading for today...

This section is strongly based on (who's?) determination of Avagadro's
number. But we will not go into the math (lame).

We need to work with a finite set of possibilities. We need to restrict
the range of hypotheses when testing things. 

Stuff about QED. Light is both a wave and a particle so philosophers
were both right and wrong debating about it. 

Descartes thought you could model light as particulate. What is
important about this is that he was using a model for it. A model which
was impossible for him to verify. He reconstructed the phenomena in
terms he could understand. But was he actually saying that light is made
out of particulate pieces. 

Lord Kelvin thought that you had to have a relatable model to understand an
associated theory. However for somethings this is not really possible
such as quantum mechanics. 

There are some ideas in science which simply are not relatable to things
we are familiar with. Such as the statistical phenomena of quantum
mechanics. There is no mechanical analog to the randomness which comes
from QM. 

Why be a realist?

Is there any way to argue that you should be a realist?
Duhem's conclusion: antirealism, because there is no thorough way to know
that things actually are the way you claim they are. 


## To recap:
Duhem thinks there is a psychological compulsion to be a realist. Because
it is just the sort of things humans tend to do. 

Your choice of metaphysics is just that, a choice. 

instrumentalisim is another form of antirealism. 

## Something else...
One way to think about this is to think "are two theories generally
distinct" 

T1 is different if under certain conditions it gives you separate
predictions from T2. 

Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, vs Schrodingers wave mechanics. GR vs
Newtonian mechanics.
